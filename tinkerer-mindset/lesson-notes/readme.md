## Guiding Questions

First, look up the [JavaScript date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). Spend a few minutes reading about it. Then, tinker with the object to answer the following questions:

- What is the JavaScript date object?
- How do you use it?
- How can you get the current date?
- How can you get the current time?
- How can you get just the day of the week?
- How can you determine the date that was 11 days ago?
- How can you determine the day the week of the Fourth of July will be next year?
- How many minutes have passed since the first day of this module?

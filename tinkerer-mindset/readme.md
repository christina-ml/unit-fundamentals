# Tinkerer Mindset

We live in a society that values efficiency; we live busy and full lives and always want to make the most of our time. Many consider maximizing our learning with the least effort to get the highest reward. There are countless tips and tricks to read faster, memorize more, and do better on exams. But exams rarely reflect someone's ability to do a job. Mainly, they check for knowledge and test how good someone is at taking tests. They don't test how good someone is at something (skill) and rarely provide the opportunity to let someone demonstrate their whole abilities, especially around problem-solving.

This program aims to help you gain the skills you need to get and succeed at a job. A key factor to this kind of success is problem-solving. Problem-solving is an individual, non-linear, no one size fits all skill set. While there are some guidelines to follow, becoming good at problem-solving involves time, practice, and shifting your mindset.

One way to improve problem-solving is to approach things with a tinkerer mindset. A tinkerer is someone who enjoys experimenting with machines and their parts. Often, a tinkerer is busying oneself with experimenting with something which may not have useful results. However, in tinkering, they are learning and building their problem-solving skills.

## Introduction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe a tinkerer mindset and how it differs from other learning mindsets.
- Given a small set of information, ask clarifying questions that lead to new paths of understanding.
- Given a small set of code, "tinker" with the code to better understand how it works.

## Student vs. Tinkerer

You may notice that there are no final grades for a module; by the end of the program, you don't end up with a GPA. While you get feedback, this is only for you and that one lab or project to help you understand how you are doing and where you need to improve. It is intentional that you don't have an ongoing tally that determines a grade because this program expects you to struggle and grow through failing. If you are afraid to fail, you won't grow as much. So, rather than trying to accumulate the most points, this program strives to help you grow as much as you can through experience and putting in the effort.

At first, you are new to coding, so much time is spent introducing and practicing fundamentals. But to move to the next level, you must practice independently.

Tinkering allows you to explore a concept or some code in a different way than memorizing it. By learning how something works, you can recall how to use it faster and debug your code better.

With tinkering, it is encouraged to make mistakes, to figure out how things work by breaking them or doing something wrong with the code; it's all just code and can be easily changed back.

As you tinker, here are some things to check that you are doing:

- Making mistakes
- Making discoveries
- Sharing your work
- Fixing things
- Getting feedback
- Playing with purpose
- Listening to others
- Changing your mind as you learn new things

As you tinker, check in with yourself and see how you're doing with the following:

- Building grit, determination, perseverance, and resilience
- Building self-efficacy
- Building a self-starter mentality
- Improving problem-solving skills

- Identify what recursion is and when it can be useful to implement.
- Identify the key components of a recursive function.
- Rewrite algorithms that use loops to use recursion.
- Rewrite algorithms that use recursion to use loops.

## Guiding Questions

- What is recursion, and why is it used in programming?

- Explain the two essential properties of a recursive function.

- What is a base case, and why is it essential in recursive functions?

- Can you provide an example of a problem that can be solved using recursion? Explain how you would approach solving it recursively.

- How does a recursive function differ from an iterative (loop-based) function?

- What happens if a recursive function doesn't have a base case? Why is this a problem?

### Summing a list of numbers

- Walk through the step-by-step process of summing the numbers 1 to 10 using recursion, as described in pre-reading.
- How would you modify the recursive function to sum the numbers from 1 to n, where n is a user-provided input?

### Determining if a number is even or odd with recursion

- Describe the problem of whether a positive integer is even or odd using recursion. What are the base cases?
- Would this recursive approach work if you had to determine if a negative integer is even or odd? Why or why not?

### Fibonacci sequence using recursion

- Explain the Fibonacci sequence and the recurrence relation used to calculate it recursively.

- Walk through the steps of calculating the 3rd and 5th Fibonacci numbers using recursion, as described in the pre-reading.

- What is the time complexity of the recursive Fibonacci function, and why is it considered inefficient for large values of n?

### Loop-Based Fibonacci

- Compare and contrast the recursive and loop-based approaches to calculating Fibonacci numbers in terms of efficiency and readability.

- Write a loop-based function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number and explain why it's more efficient than the recursive version.

### Memoization (Optional):

- Briefly explain memoization and how it can improve the efficiency of recursive functions. Why might it be helpful for the Fibonacci problem?

- Describe how you would implement memoization in the Fibonacci recursive function and what benefits it would provide.
